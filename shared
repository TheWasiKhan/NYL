Subject: IDMS Support for Double Data Type Length (15 Characters)
 
HI Gokul/sreeni,
 
Currently, the IDMS system supports the double data type with a maximum length of 15 characters.
However, in DataStage, the configuration for this data type allows for lengths greater than 15 characters.
As a result, when comparing data between N1 and Conv, 
values that exceed the 15-character limit are being truncated, leading to discrepancies and mismatches.
We would appreciate your assistance in addressing this issue to ensure consistent data handling across the systems.
 
Please let me know if you require any further information or clarification regarding this issue.
 
Thank you.
